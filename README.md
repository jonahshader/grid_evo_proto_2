# grid_evo_proto_2
Simulation of competitive evolution between two species

This program uses a genetic algorithm to evolve the behavior of two species. One species, called the virus, tries to get as far to the right side as possible, while the antivirus species tries to prevent the virus from approaching the right side. This leads to competitive behavior where the antivirus deploys barriers to prevent the virus from proceeding. The virus then evolves to find ways around these barriers.
